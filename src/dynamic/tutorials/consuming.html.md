### Requirements
Before you start you may want to install the [CoApp Developer Tools](/tutorials/installation.html) or at least install NuGet.

* NuGet 2.5 or later  
> 2.5 Release : https://nuget.codeplex.com/releases
> Install the Visual Studio Integration component (VSIX)

	
### Finding packages
You can find the CoApp signed packages on CoApp profile via the NuGet website or on github. Packages made with the CoApp Developer Tools should also appear in the nuget repository with the tag 'native' or 'CoApp' - some made by other developers and not signed by CoApp.

* CoApp Published & Signed Packages
> CoApp Profile on nuget : http://nuget.org/profiles/coapp/
> CoApp-packages on GitHub : https://github.com/coapp-packages

* Search for 'native' or 'coapp' in NuGet 
> http://nuget.org/packages?q=native
> http://nuget.org/packages?q=CoApp

### Installing packages

* Inside Visual Studio with NuGet
> Please follow this tutorial : [Using The Package Manager Console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console)
