I figured I'd take a quick break, and review the fine wisdom my old pappy has imparted to my blog:

Like my pappy always used to tell me **"It may not be the easy way, but it's the cowboy way"**. Well, WinSxS may not be the easy way (yet!), but it will most assuredly be the CoApp way. ([see CoApp FAQ][news:20100415faq])

My pappy always used to tell me, *"Never squat with your spurs on"*. Good advice, and here's a bit more, so pay attention. ([see CoApp FAQ][news:20100415faq])

It reminds me of somethin' my pappy told me... **"Always take a good look at what you're about to eat. It's not so important to know what it is, but it sure is crucial to know what it was"**. That kind of advice works really well for security, just as it did for those odd-tastin'' sausages we barbeque'd up that night. (see [news][news:20070205])

My pappy always used to say **"Don't judge people by their relatives"** - good advice at the best of times.(http://fearthecowboy.com/post/How-to-move-the-herd-one-open-source-project-at-a-time.aspx)

It reminds me of somethin' my pappy told me... **"There are three kinds of men: The ones that learn by reading. The few who learn by observation. The rest of them have to pee on the electric fence"**.  Well, I think I ended up in the last category, but at least I learned somethin'...

Perhaps you should what my pappy always used to tell me: **"Don't try to understand 'em, Just rope, throw, and brand 'em"**. Now, it's entirely possible he was talkin' about cattle and not code at the time, but I figure it's good advice at the best of times. (see [CoApp FAQ][news:20100413faq]

'Course, my pappy always used to tell me **"it don't take a genius to spot a goat in flock of sheep"** ... Sure, it's easy to see what the problem is, question is, how do we go about fixin' it? [see [news][news:20100407])

I remember what my pappy told me about tryin' to change the world: **"If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then to make sure it's still there with ya"**.  Well, I'll keep checkin', but y'all gotta try to keep up. (http://fearthecowboy.com/post/Open-Source-at-Microsoft-Herdin-cats-or-Cow-Chips.aspx)

As my pappy use'd to say **"Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier than puttin' it back"**.  If I give a site a password, and they require me to divulge the password back to them before granting me access, It's my butt between the bull and the fence if the connection between me and them ain't secure.

Uh-oh. My pappy used to remind me of two things about gettin' into trouble. First, **"Never slap a man who's chewing tobacco"** ... that's good advice you can't afford to forget. The second is a little more on-topic, "If you find yourself in a hole, stop diggin' ." (http://fearthecowboy.com/post/Me-and-my-PPID-Can-I-rely-on-it.aspx)
