(cross-posted to the [mailing list][developer:mailinglist])

I'm doing some initial work for long term planning today-really this will help drive my focus over the next year or two.

Assuming that CoApp produces a beautifully functioning package manager and ecosystem, what open source packages would you like to see made available for Windows via CoApp?

I've stated before that my personal focus is around PHP, Apache and Python (courtesy of the folks kind enough to pay for my time on the project).

What would you like? What software or libraries would you find compelling? What is #1 in your list? On the server? On the client? In the cloud?

What is the priority of that (say on a scale of one to five stars)?
