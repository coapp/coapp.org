After a break of nearly a month, I'm back in the CoApp groove, and now it's finally time to announce our summer coding contest!

## The Stick-A-Fork-In-CoApp contest


Our goal over the summer is to generate a whole slew of nice, clean shallow forks 
that we can use both as test cases for completing the packaging tools as well as producing 
the packages for general consumption.

I've managed to get our sponsors (the Outercurve Foundation and Microsoft) to donate some prizes:

>> **Two** XBOX 360 Arcade with Kinect + games bundles<br>
>> **Three** Kinect 3d Motion Controllers<br>
>> **Lots** of XBox 360 Games (list coming soon)<br>
>> **Lots** of XBox Live Subscriptions<br>
>> **Lots** of XBox Live Points cards<br>
>> Microsoft Keyboards (Arc Keyboard, Sidewinder Keyboard)<br> 
>> Microsoft Arc Mice<br>
>> T-Shirts<br>

We're hoping to hit about 200 shallow-forks this summer, which will be an
awesome start to getting a lot of top-notch open source software running on Windows.


Additionally, you can get entries into the contest for filing or fixing bugs as well as filling in documentation for the CoApp project
