The CoApp mailing list is the place where most of the detailed discussions about CoApp project developement occur. It also is the place where users send support requests and e-mail questions which do not fit very well the real-time chats on [IRC](/developres/irc.html) channel.

Currently, there is only one mailing list dedicated to CoApp. In future, it may split into several lists, specific to certain topics or target groups like developers, package maintainers and users.
