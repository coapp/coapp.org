### Introduction

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is the main real-time communication channel of the CoApp community.

If you are a user looking for help, a developer willing to help, or anybody who wants to contribute to the CoApp project, feel encouraged to join the CoApp community on IRC. Joining real-time discussions on IRC is the fastest and one of the most effective way to get in touch with developers, users and enthusiasts gathered around the CoApp project.
