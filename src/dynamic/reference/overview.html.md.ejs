# A Brief Explanation of CoApp

## The Basics

#### So what is this thing?
Honesty compels me to say that CoApp is just another piece of software that helps manage your computer.

That being said, a great deal of effort has gone into making CoApp do this as streamlined as possible to avoid reducing computer performance.  In fact, one of the key purposes behind CoApp is to reduce the clutter that most existing software litters upon your system (more details on how we do this can be found **[here][tech]**).

#### Ok, so what does it do that I really care about?
In short, CoApp makes it easier to install and update software.  Any software.  We make no restrictions upon what can use CoApp to make the end-user experience better.

#### That sounds suspicious.  What else is there to this?
The original purpose of CoApp was so that we (and everyone else) could have an easier time installing open source software (OSS) on Windows.  A mild side effect was that it also worked really well for managing **ALL** types of software.

#### Ok, I think I'm almost convinced.  Where can I find software that uses CoApp?
I'm glad you asked.  A list of packages that are readily available can be found [in the package repository][packages].
Other packages and repositories may be available elsewhere on the internet, but this is the only repository maintained and verified by the CoApp team.

## Technical Stuff
This is where I tell you about all of the cool things that CoApp is doing for you that you may or may not actually see when using it.  For the sake of the average reader, I'm going to try going light on the technical jargon.

#### Benefits of CoApp Over Existing Software
The first item of note is that CoApp is the first ever (that we're aware of) package management system of its kind for Windows.  By that I mean that nothing else exists that will let so many varieties of software install and update this easily and seamlessly.

With that little bit of pride out of the way, here's a list of things that CoApp provides:

* Every CoApp software package has been digitally signed by the publisher, so you always know who actually made the software available to you. ([details here][tech])

* CoApp eliminates redundant files among various programs, removing program incompatibilities and saving you precious space that you can better use for photos, music, movies, and other important data.  ([details here][tech])

* CoApp eliminates the need to manually find and install pre-requisites to install software packages.  CoApp will do the for you automatically when you go to install the package you actually want.  This is especially helpful when working with OSS.  ([details here][tech])

That covers most of the high points without going into significantly more technical detail.  If you'd like to read more or if you are a developer interested in some of the details of the software, read on in the [technical background paper][tech].
