subtitle: What is CoApp
---
The Common Opensource Application Publishing Platform, or CoApp for short, is an open-source package 
management system for Windows.  The goal of the CoApp project is to create a community of developers dedicated to creating a set of tools and processes that enable other open source developers to create and maintain their open source products with Windows as a primary build target.  

Mary-Jo Foley of ZDNet gives her perspective on what CoApp aspires to be: [CoApp: An open-source package-management system for Windows](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/coapp-an-open-source-package-management-system-for-windows/5762)
